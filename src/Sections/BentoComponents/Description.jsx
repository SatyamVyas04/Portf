					I hail from the city of Mumbai, often dubbed the "city of
					dreams." It's here amidst the bustling streets and vibrant
					culture that I've embarked on my educational journey, from
					the early days of grade school to the challenges of high
					school. Now, as I navigate the corridors of higher
					education, I find myself pursuing my Bachelor's degree at
					the esteemed Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai.
					This city has been more than just a backdrop; it's been a
					constant source of inspiration and growth, shaping my
					aspirations and molding my character.

				<p className="smallsubtext">
					Beyond academia, I find joy in exploring diverse interests
					and hobbies. Whether it's immersing myself in the latest
					technological innovations, diving into the pages of a
					captivating book, or simply unwinding with friends over a
					cup of coffee, I embrace each experience as an opportunity
					for discovery and personal enrichment. I believe in the
					power of continuous learning and strive to expand my
					horizons, both professionally and personally. As I journey
					through life's adventures, I approach each day with
					enthusiasm, curiosity, and a steadfast determination to make
					a positive impact on the world around me.
